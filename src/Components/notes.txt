Change screen rendered dynamically based on objects "type"

Data fetching is also dynamically changed based on screen category
  data[top-level] is all that is capable atm
    Currently based on string values, can I make it based on variables
    Or have category string get parsed on symbol for digging?
      Stupid and Sloppy like your mother
    Or make top level objects so digging isn't a problem?
      Defeats the purpose of nested structure if Converse is outside of Shoes
    Or have category retrieved before nav
      see renderComponents _Card notes

    Draw out whole function system, may help
  need data[top-level][sub-level][sub-level]
